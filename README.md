![Vital Vial Title](README_Images/Title.png)

Vital Vial is a game where you must fight for your life. Fight through endless waves of zombies as you unlock supernatural abilities and increase your arsenal. Go for the highscore by completing as many waves and killing as many zombies as you can.

# Tech Tree

As you kill enemies you will earn experience points.\
As you earn experience points, you will level up.\
When you level up, you gain skill points.\
You can spend these skill points in the tech tree to unlock new abilities and weapons.

The tech tree is laid out such that you must get the previous ability/upgrade before you can get the next. (The previous is whichever is furthest down the line towards the player icon at the top center of the tech tree).
